# Hackintosh-EFI-Partion
## Hey Guys, This is the EFI Partition I use to run this build:
* Z490 Aorus Ultra
* i7 10700k
* RX 580

## if you want to use this EFI and be able to get all the apple apps to work you have to navigate to the OC/config.plist
* in here you have to modify the SystemProductName, SystemSerialNumber, SystemUUID with a randomaly generate one from CLOVER. Once you do that save it.

## you can find more documention on the opencore web page. Remember you have to set up your mobo bios.
